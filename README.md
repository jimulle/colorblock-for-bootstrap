colorblock-for-bootstrap
========================

create an edge to edge background effect without the headaches of container-fluid

the project started out as a solution to a specific client need and i have modified the scss script to make it a generic mixin for use in other projects based on the bootstrap framework. 
currently (initially) the script is available in SASS because that is the requirement for my original client, but I would like to extend the same functionality to LESS and vanilla CSS as well
