colorblock-for-bootstrap
========================

create an edge to edge background effect without the headaches of container-fluid

The project started out as a solution to a specific client need and i have modified the SASS file to make it a generic mixin for use in other projects based on the bootstrap framework.

The project is available in SASS and vanilla CSS.
